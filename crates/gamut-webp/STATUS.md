# gamut-webp — implementation status

The complete component surface a conformant WebP encoder **and** decoder needs, drawn from the WebP
specs (RFC 9649 *WebP Image Format*; the Google *WebP Container*, *WebP Lossless Bitstream*, and
*Compression Techniques* references) and the VP8 spec (RFC 6386 *VP8 Data Format and Decoding
Guide*). Rows are **technical components**, not user features. This is the map for extension: each
module's doc comment cites the same spec section, and a row flips ☐→✅ (with the module
cross-reference) when it ships.

gamut is **image-first**: only the intra-frame / key-frame still-image subset of VP8 is in scope —
no inter-frame prediction, motion, or sequence coding. Unlike most of the workspace (encoder-first),
gamut-webp ships a **native decoder** too: the Rust ecosystem's WebP decoders all wrap libwebp,
whose memory-unsafety drove CVEs such as the zero-click CVE-2023-4863, so a `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`
decoder is worth carrying. The in-crate decoder also doubles as the encoder's tier-2 oracle.

**Status:** ✅ = implemented · ☐ = planned (in scope) · ⊘ = out of scope (tracked for
container-completeness only). **Milestone (M)** is indicative sequencing, not a contract:

- **M0** — ✅ **done**: the RIFF/WebP container (read + write) and the minimal **VP8L lossless**
  still-image path (header, LSB bit I/O, canonical prefix codes, image data with the subtract-green
  transform), 8-bit RGB, simple file format (`RIFF`/`WEBP`/`VP8L`). `WebpEncoder::lossless` + native
  `WebpDecoder`. Verified bit-exact against libwebp (`libwebp-sys`) and against gamut's own decoder.
- **M1** — ✅ **done**: VP8L full — predictor / color / color-indexing transforms, LZ77 backward
  references, color cache, meta prefix codes — bit-exact lossless. The **decoder** reads the entire
  spec (any conformant stream); the **encoder** emits every feature and, since issue #31, chooses
  between candidate encodings of them under the `Effort` ladder.
- **M2** — ✅ **done**: **VP8 lossy** key-frame intra — boolean entropy coder, frame header, intra
  prediction (16×16 DC/V/H/TM, per-4×4 B_PRED, chroma), Y2/WHT + integer 4×4 DCT, dequantization,
  zig-zag token coding, simple + normal loop filters, quantizer segmentation, 1/2/4/8 token
  partitions, per-macroblock skip. BT.601 YCbCr 4:2:0 added to gamut-color. `WebpEncoder::lossy`.
  **Bit-exact against libwebp in both directions** (gamut↔libwebp YUV) plus a malformed-input
  robustness corpus. Rate/entropy tuning under the `Effort` ladder landed with issue #32.
- **M3** — ✅ **done**: Extended container (encode + decode) — `VP8X` feature header + alpha (`ALPH`,
  raw and lossless), simple→extended promotion, RGBA API (`encode_rgba8` / `decode_to_rgba8`).
  libwebp recovers gamut's exact alpha and gamut recovers libwebp's. Alpha is a flagship still-image
  feature; `VP8X` is its enabler.
- **M4** — Color & metadata (**in scope**, embed on encode + preserve on decode): `ICCP` ICC
  profiles and `EXIF` / `XMP ` metadata are ✅ **done** (issue #302) — `WebpEncoder::with_icc_profile`
  / `with_exif` / `with_xmp` embed the payloads verbatim (promoting a simple file to `VP8X` and
  deriving the feature flags from the chunks present), and the `gamut_webp::metadata` free function
  reads them back without decoding pixels; libwebp's own muxer is the oracle in both directions.
  Read-side chunk-order enforcement and unknown-chunk round-trip preservation closed with
  `gamut-riff` v1 (issue #186): `gamut_riff::WebpLayout::parse` is the single container walk behind
  both decode paths, and `WebpEncoder::with_unknown_chunks` re-emits preserved chunks.
- **M5** — Animation: `ANIM` / `ANMF` — **out of scope** (decision 2026-06-09). Multi-frame
  sequences fall outside the image-first charter and the single-image `gamut_core` traits; WebP
  animation needs no codec work (each frame is an independent keyframe) but does need a non-trait
  multi-frame API. Rows are kept for container-completeness only: encode is not planned, decode may
  be revisited later. See [Scope decisions](#scope-decisions--non-core-feature-paths).
- **M6** — ✅ **done**: Decoder hardening — the libwebp interop matrix (both directions, including
  decoding cwebp's segmentation / per-segment filter / probability-update / compressed-alpha streams)
  and a malformed / truncated / exhaustive-bit-flip robustness corpus (no panics; typed errors).

The numbering of the two parts mirrors the two reference families: **Part 1** (sections A–F) is the
WebP container + VP8L lossless surface from `references/webp/`; **Part 2** (sections G–N) is the VP8
lossy-intra surface from `references/vp8/`. Section O is the cross-cutting API / oracle / tooling.

## Scope decisions — non-core feature paths

The core surface is the single still image (VP8L lossless + VP8 lossy intra, 8-bit RGB). Beyond
that, WebP's RIFF container carries optional chunks; this table records the **scope decision** for
each non-core path (in/out, and encode vs. decode), so the component tables below can be read against
a settled charter rather than a wish-list. `gamut-riff` already recognizes every FourCC involved
(`WebpChunkId`), so these are product-scope calls, not capability gaps.

| Feature path | Chunks | Decision | Encode | Decode | M | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alpha / transparency | VP8L native ARGB; `ALPH` + `VP8X` (lossy) | **In scope** | ✅ | ✅ | M3 | Flagship still-image feature (PNG-parity). VP8L alpha is free in ARGB; lossy alpha needs `ALPH` + `VP8X`. |
| Extended container | `VP8X` | **In scope** | ✅ | ✅ | M3 | Required enabler for lossy alpha, ICC, and metadata. Emitted only when a feature needs it (simple→extended promotion). |
| Color profile | `ICCP` | **In scope** | ✅ embed | ✅ preserve | M4 | Color correctness on wide-gamut images. |
| Metadata | `EXIF`, `XMP ` | **In scope** | ✅ embed | ✅ preserve | M4 | Cheap round-trip passthrough; preserved across decode→encode. |
| Animation | `ANIM`, `ANMF` | **Out of scope** (tracked only) | ✕ | deferred | M5 | Sequence content, against the image-first charter ("no video sequences") and the single-image `gamut_core` traits. Each `ANMF` frame is an independent keyframe — no codec work needed — but assembly requires a non-trait multi-frame API. Rows kept for container-completeness; a decode-only path may be revisited later. |

Markers: ✅ shipped · ✕ not planned · *deferred* = possible later, no commitment now.
